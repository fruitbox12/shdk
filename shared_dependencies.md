Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. '../public/vercel.svg': This is a shared resource file that is being imported in the Navbar.tsx component.

2. './react': This is a package path that is being exported from the next-auth package and is used in the auth.ts file.

3. 'axios': This is a package that is being used in the projects.ts file.

4. '../../lib/auth': This is a module that is being imported in the [id].tsx file located in the projects directory of the dashboard.

5. '../../lib/projects': This is another module that is being imported in the [id].tsx file located in the projects directory of the dashboard.

Please note that without the actual code, it's not possible to provide the names of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names. The above-mentioned dependencies are inferred based on the import statements and the error messages provided in the prompt.
