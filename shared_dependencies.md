The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. '../public/vercel.svg': This is a shared resource file that is being imported in the Navbar.tsx component.

2. './react': This is a package path that is not being exported from the next-auth package. It is a shared dependency in the auth.ts file.

3. 'axios': This is a shared dependency in the projects.ts file. It is a popular HTTP client for making requests.

4. '../../lib/auth': This is a shared module that is being imported in the [id].tsx file in the projects directory of the dashboard.

5. '../../lib/projects': This is another shared module that is being imported in the [id].tsx file in the projects directory of the dashboard.

6. 'yarn run build': This is a shared command that is being run to compile the application. It is failing due to webpack errors.

7. 'next-auth/package.json': This is a shared file that contains the metadata of the next-auth package. It is being referenced in the error message related to the './react' path.

Please note that without the actual code, it's hard to provide the exact shared exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names. The above are inferred from the error messages.
